Carton Collective 

Carton Collective is a Phase 5 final project that was created during my time in FlatIron’s Full Stack Web Developer Program. It was a project started out of love for comics and the comic artist community.
Carton Collective operates as a web application/site that you can log into, create an account, add a comic and pages to your comic to share on your own personalized profile. 
Installation
Git clone the repository 
Cd into backend and hit bundle install
Now type in console, rails s to start the server it should open in a separate browser at localhost:3000
Now cd into the frontend and type npm I (npm install)
Type in the console npm start to start the frontend server 
Once this is done it should open in another window once you select ‘Y’ (localhost:3001 for example)
This application runs using Rails as its backend and SQL Lite for the backend database. The frontend uses the React Framework and Material UI for CSS
